# Logo File Needed

The redesign is complete, but you'll need to add your sweatpance logo to the project:

1. Save your sweatpance logo image (the white text on black background with the drippy 'e') as:
   - `img/sweatpance-logo.png`

2. The HTML already references this file at: `img/sweatpance-logo.png`

3. Recommended logo dimensions: 300px width (to match the original logo size)

Once you add the logo file, the redesign will be complete!
