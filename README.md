# SPANCE-99

SPANCE-99 is a web-based drum synthesizer by **sweatpance**, inspired by the legendary Roland TR-909 drum machine from the 1980s.

## What Is SPANCE-99?

SPANCE-99 is a programmable drum machine using a combination of synthesized and sampled sounds. It features a sleek monochrome design with orange accent highlights, embodying the sweatpance aesthetic while maintaining the power and flexibility of classic drum machines.

All of the drums are [synthesized using the WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). The hi-hats, crash, and ride cymbals are produced from sampled audio.

The TR-909 drum machine that inspired this project is an analog sound design masterpiece. You can read circuit analysis about its clever use of noise and bandpass filters over on [Network 909](http://www.network-909.de/circuit.htm).
